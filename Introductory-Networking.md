# Introductory Networking
  * Room: Introductory Networking<br>
  * Difficulty: Easy<br>
  * Category: Network<br>
  * Date Completed: 15-08-2025<br>
  * Link: https://tryhackme.com/room/introtonetworking

# Purpose 
  * Iâ€™ve learned networking before, but this room was suggested in a Medium article, so I decided to try it too.<br>
  Here's the link to the article : https://medium.com/@polygonben/ejpt-a-guide-on-how-to-pass-first-time-f8cec3f79a73<br>

# Key Learnings 
  * Learned about OSI and TCP/IP Models, Process of encapsulation and De-encapsulation, How three-way handshake works,
  and also learned about some basic tools like : ping, traceroute, WHOIS, Dig.<br>

# Tools 
  * ping : The ping command is used when we want to test whether a connection to a remote resource is possible.<br>
  
```bash
shaivarth@Sarthaks-MacBook-Air-4 ~ % ping google.com
PING google.com (142.251.220.46): 56 data bytes

```
  * traceroute : Traceroute can be used to map the path your request takes as it heads to the target.<br>


```bash
shaivarth@Sarthaks-MacBook-Air-4 ~ % traceroute google.com

  * whois : Whois essentially allows you to query who a domain name is registered to, you can potentially get a great deal of information from a whois search. Sometimes some data is Redacted, like i searched for my college website   [vitbhopal.ac.in], most info was 'REDACTED'.

```bash
shaivarth@Sarthaks-MacBook-Air-4 ~ % whois google.com

# Lessons Learned

 1. The ping command can be used to test reachability and latency.
 2. TTL (Time To Live) values indicate network hops allowed.
 3. traceroute shows intermediate hops between the source and destination.
 4. '*' indicates packet loss or filtered ICMP responses.
 5. High latency in some hops may indicate network congestion.
