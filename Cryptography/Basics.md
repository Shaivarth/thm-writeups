# Task 1
# Purpose:
    The purpose of this task was to understand why cryptography is essential, its role in secure communication, and where it is applied in real-world scenarios.

# Key Learnings:
    Cryptography is mainly used to keep our information safe by providing confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. We actually use it every day without noticing. For example, when we log in somewhere, our username and password are encrypted before being sent so no one can steal them. SSH uses encryption to make sure no one can spy on our remote sessions. In online banking, certificates are used to confirm that we are really talking to the bank and not a fake website. Even when we download files, we use hashes to check if the file is complete and not tampered with. Apart from these daily uses, there are also rules and standards that organizations must follow. For example, PCI DSS is required for handling credit card information, HIPAA and HITECH deal with medical data in the USA, GDPR protects personal data in Europe, and DPA is followed in the UK.


# Lessons Learned
    Credit card data requires compliance with PCI DSS.
