# Purpose 
  Iâ€™ve learned networking before, but this room was suggested in a Medium article, so I decided to try it too.<br>
  Here's the link to the article : https://medium.com/@polygonben/ejpt-a-guide-on-how-to-pass-first-time-f8cec3f79a73<br>

# Key Learnings 
  Learned about OSI and TCP/IP Models, Process of encapsulation and De-encapsulation, How three-way handshake works,<br>
  and also learned about some basic tools like : ping, traceroute, WHOIS, Dig.<br>

# Tools 
  * ping : The ping command is used when we want to test whether a connection to a remote resource is possible.<br>

  * traceroute : Traceroute can be used to map the path your request takes as it heads to the target machine.<br>
